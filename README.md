# 4501-Final-Project

## Description of What Has Been Implemented
In this project, we processed and analyzed ride data from NYC Yellow Taxi and Uber services between January 2020 and August 2024, integrating it with historical weather data. The implementation includes downloading and cleaning large datasets, creating representative samples using Cochranâ€™s formula, and normalizing data structures for efficient storage in a SQLite database. We implemented SQL queries to answer key analytical questions, such as identifying the most popular hours for rides, the impact of weather conditions on ride patterns, and the effect of distance and precipitation on tipping behavior. Additionally, we created insightful visualizations, including time-series plots, scatter plots, and a geospatial heatmap, to illustrate trends and patterns in the data.
